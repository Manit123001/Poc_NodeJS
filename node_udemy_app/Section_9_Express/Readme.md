#### Big word alert
- Envonment variables: global variables specific to the environment (server) our code is living in  different server can have different variable settings, and we can access those variable in code


- HTTP Method: specifies the type of action the request wishes to make GET, POST DELETE and other. Also called verbs.


- Middleware: code that sits between two layers of software. In the case of Express, sitting between the request and the response.


- Static: Not dynamic. 
In other words not processed by code in any way. For example HTML, CSS and image files are 'static' files.

### Resful API and JSON
- Rest : an architectural style for building APIs. Stands for 'Representational State Transfer'. We decide that  HTTP verbs and URLs mean something.
